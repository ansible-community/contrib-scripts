**This repository is no longer maintained and archived**. 

These were the old inventory and vault scripts contributed to Ansible.
If you disagree with this decision and are offering to maintain these scripts (ensure they are valid on current and future
release of Ansible), contact the [Ansible Community Team](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/communication.html).
